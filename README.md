# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
A Project on classifying credit card transactions being legit or fraudulent

## DATASET CONTENT:

The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA. The feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount. The feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

## Project Goals:

* Develop an advanced credit card fraud detection and prevention system capable of analyzing large volumes of transaction data in real-time.
* Implement robust machine learning algorithms and techniques to accurately identify and flag fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and negatives.
* Evaluate the effectiveness of different machine learning models and sampling techniques to determine the optimal approach for credit card fraud detection and prevention.
